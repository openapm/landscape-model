  # stagemonitor browser widget
  - id: stagemonitor-browserwidget
    name: stagemonitor Widget
    description: The stagemonitor in browser widget lets you analyze metrics and call trees in your browser without installing a backend. If you are monitoring a web application (with servlet api >= 3) the in browser stagemonitor widget is automatically injected in your site. In case you have a REST or similar web application with no UI, then the widget is available under a specific sub-URL of your application.

  # stagemonitor alerter
  - id: stagemonitor-alerter
    name: stagemonitor Alerter
    description: The stagemonitor alerting component lets you define thresholds for any metric collected by stagemonitor like for example the request response times or the rate of error-level logs. To get started you don't need any backend. Just add a dependency to stagemonitor-alerting. After restarting your server, the in browser widget now has a "Alerts" tab.

  # stagemonitor os plugin
  - id: stagemonitor-os
    name: stagemonitor OS
    description: The stagemonitor os component lets you collect operating system metrics. The first option is to include the stagemonitor-os plugin to your application. The disadvantage is, that your application has to run in order to collect and report the OS metrics and that you might collect the same metrics multiple times when you have several applications running on the same host. That's why it is possible to run stagemonitor-os as a standalone application.
