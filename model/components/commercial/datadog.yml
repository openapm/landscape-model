    name: Datadog
    description: Datadog is a powerfull data, monitoring and observability platform covering the three pillars of observability (metrics, traces and logs). Datadog comes with an flexible and consistent tagging concept that allows correlation of different data types as well as flexible filtering and grouping of data. It provides open interfaces for ingesting data from different data collection utilities and standards and, thus, is highly integrateable with different open source monitoring components.
